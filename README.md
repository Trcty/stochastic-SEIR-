# stochastic-SEIR-
The project focuses on simulation of stochastic SEIR  model using Gillespieâ€™s direct method. How basic reproduction number affects possibility of extinction in stochastic SEIR model is also investigaed. Dynamics of different compartments in deterministic and stochastic SEIR are compared and visualized as well.

Results are summarized in Stochastic SEIR Model.pdf 

All simulations are ran in run_simulation.m file, and rest .m files are helper functions.
